# Clinic Booking System

## 📋 Project Title
**Clinic Booking System (MySQL Database Project)**

## 📄 Description
This project implements a complete relational database for a clinic management system using MySQL. It allows for effective management of:
- Doctor and department information
- Patient records
- Appointment scheduling
- Diagnoses and medications
- Many-to-many relations between appointments and prescribed medications

The system enforces data integrity using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and proper normalization to at least 3NF.

## ⚙️ How to Run / Setup the Project

### Requirements:
- MySQL Server (e.g., MySQL Workbench or XAMPP)
- A database client for executing SQL scripts

### Steps:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client.
3. Create a new schema (e.g., `clinic_booking`).

   - This file contains all `CREATE TABLE` statements with constraints and relationships.
5. Execute the script to build the database schema.
